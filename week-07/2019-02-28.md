# Using Django As An API 

Today's material is largely based off of [WS Vincent's tutorial](https://wsvincent.com/django-rest-framework-tutorial/). A huge shoutout / thanks to him!

So far we've been using Django to create full stack web applications. This type of app, where both the front and back end are coupled together into a single code base, is called a monolithic application. It works, but as applications grow to hundreds of thousands of lines of code it can become a nightmare to debug and add new features. A more modern way of creating web applications is to separate the front and back end code. Moving forward, we'll use Django to handle our back end and React JS to handle all of our front end logic. So what does this mean? It means that Django will only be in charge of our database. Rather than responding to requests with a full web page (HTML, CSS, Javascript etc.) it will only deliver data in the form of JSON. 

## Django REST Framework 

Our Django API will still need to have the same CRUD functionality as our previous full stack Django apps. The only difference is that our views will return JSON instead of HTML. This is such a common pattern that several tools have been created to make developing CRUD apps in Django much easier and much more efficient. One popular tool that we'll be using going forward is called [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)

This framework sits on top of Django and adds some extra functionality that will make our lives much easier. 

## Setting Up Our Api 

Let's start by creating a new Django project. Remember to create a new venv. We'll also use `psycopg2` so that Django can talk to our postgresql database. 


```bash 
$ django-admin startproject wine_api
$ cd wine_api
$ ./manage.py startapp wines
```
Then let's create our model. 

```python
# wines/models.py 
from django.db import models
from django.utils import timezone

class Wine(models.Model):
  name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
  price = models.CharField(max_length=10)
  varietal = models.CharField(max_length=255)
  description = models.TextField()
  created_at = models.DateTimeField(default=timezone.now)

  def __str__(self):
    return self.name 
```
Next, create some dummy data to work with. The nice thing is that we still have access to the Django admin panel. If you don't remember how to set that up, refer to this [link](https://github.com/hotelplatoon/curriculum/blob/master/week-07/2019-02-27.md). 

Once you have your admin panel set up, add some fake wines so that we have some data to test our new api with. 

## Installing Django REST Framework

Now we are ready to install the [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/). 

```bash
$ pip install djangorestframework
```

Next we need to add it to our installed apps. 

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
  'django.contrib.admin',
  'django.contrib.auth',
  'django.contrib.contenttypes',
  'django.contrib.sessions',
  'django.contrib.messages',
  'django.contrib.staticfiles',

  'wines', 
  'rest_framework'
]
```
Django REST Framework offers a ton of functionality out of the box. Feel free to check out the docs to learn more about all the amazing things it has to offer. 


### Django REST Framework Setup

We need to do three things to get our api working. First, we need to set up our routes. Next, we'll create a serializer (more on this later.) Lastly, we will import Django REST Framework's built in view functions to handle our responses. 

#### Routes 

First, add the following route to your `wine_api/urls.py` file. 

```python
# wine_api/urls.py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include 

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('wines/', include('wines.urls')) # you'll need to add this line to link to your wines urls in the wines app. 
]
```

Next, we can set up our wines routes in `wines/urls.py`. 

```python
# wines/urls.py 
from django.urls import path, include 
from .views import WineViewSet  
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'', WineViewSet, basename='wine')
urlpatterns = router.urls
```

There are a few things going on here so let's take it line by line. The first line is importing the path and include functions from django. We've seen this before. Next, we need to import our views (We haven't created those yet. We'll do that next.). Again, nothing new here. On the third line we are importing the function `DefaultRouter` from the Django REST Framework. This function is going to do most of the heavy lifting for us when it comes to our routes. Running it returns an object which we save to the variable `router`. On the next line we call a method, `register()`, which is how we add specific routes to our new router. In this case we are saying, "Please make the routes we will need for our wines api". 

The last line is the `urlpatterns` variable that Django checks every time someone makes a request to our app. We set the value `urlpatterns` to `router.urls`. 

Ok, so that was a lot. It's important to note that even though the framework we are using is doing a lot for us, it's not doing anything new. It's just abstracting away a lot of the code for us. For example, `router.urls` simply returns an array of routes based on the info we entered in `router.register()`. 

#### Serializers 

When we say serialize in this context, it is just a fancy way of saying "Convert this data from one format to another." In this case, we want to convert a Django Query object into JSON. 

Create a new file `wines/serializers.py` and copy the following code. 

```python
# wines/serializers.py 
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Wine

class WineSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
  class Meta:
    model = Wine
    fields = '__all__'
```

Once again, a lot of the code is being taken care of for us by Django REST Framework. We create our own `WineSerializer` class and let it inherit from the rest framework class `serializers.ModelSerializer`. From there we can set up some settings in the `Meta` class. In this case we tell the serializer which model (which table in the database) to get its data from and which fields we want to convert into JSON (in this case all the fields).

#### Views 

The last thing is setting up our views. Again, DRF is going to do most of the heavy lifting. 

```python
# wines/views.py 
from .models import Wine
from .serializers import WineSerializer
from rest_framework import viewsets

class WineViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
  queryset = Wine.objects.all()
  serializer_class = WineSerializer
```

Letting our `WineViewSet` inherit from `viewsets.ModelViewSet` will give us all the CRUD functionality we need in our api. We just have to set the `queryset `and `serializer_class` variables. 

#### See It Working!

##### Wines List 
Now that we have everything set up, let's test our api to make sure that it is working. 
Start your server with `python manage.py runserver` and visit `http://localhost:8000/wines/` in your browser. Because we don't have React set up yet, Django rest frame work will provide us with simple front end interface so that we can work with the data. You should see something that looks like the image below. 

![All Our Wines](./wine-list.jpg)

If you scroll down to the bottom you'll see a form to create a new wine. Give it a try. 

##### Wine Instance 
To get the data for a specific wine, add the primary key to url. To see just the first wine in the list enter `http://localhost:8000/api/1/` You'll get the data for just that wine, as well as a form to edit and update it.

# Deploying to Heroku 
Up until now we've been running all of our Django apps locally. This is great for development, but how do we deploy our apps to a server that is accessible to the rest of the internet? There are many services online designed to make this task easy for us. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is one of the most popular, but it's learning curve is pretty high. The service we will be using today, and for future projects, is called [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/). It's built on top of AWS, but it abstracts away a lot of the complexity so that deploying apps is super simple. Plus, it will allow us to deploy our app for free!

### Getting Django Ready For Heroku 
We have to add a few things to our Django app to make sure it will run properly when we deploy it.

Follow the steps linked to here https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/django-app-configuration) or read on. 
The mechanics of what we set up here may not be entirely clear to you at first. That's okay, they don't have to be. Just know that we must follow these specific steps so that Heroku knows how to run our app after we deploy it. 

#### Procfile
The first thing we need to create is a `Procfile` in our apps main directory. So for our wine app, `cd` into the `wine_api` and `touch Procfile`. Notice we don't need any dot py at the end. Here we are going to tell Heroku which web server we want to use for our app. Open the file and copy this line of code `web: gunicorn myproject.wsgi`, being sure to replace "myproject" with whatever the name of your app is. 

```python
#  Procfile 

web: gunicorn wine_api.wsgi

```
Gunicorn is the server Heroku recommends we use. Install it with `pip install gunicorn`. 


#### Django-heroku
Most of the rest of the set up is done for us by installing a final `pip` package called `django-heroku`. Run `pip install django-heroku`.

Then place `import django_heroku` at the very top of your `settings.py` file and `django_heroku.settings(locals())` at the bottom of `settings.py`. 

#### Requirements 

The final thing we need to do is create our `requirements.txt` file in the root of our directory. Heroku will use this to download all our dependencies, including `gunicorn` and `django-heroku`. 

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

That's it for prepping our app. 

#### Creating A New Heroku App 

Go to https://www.heroku.com/ and create a new account. It's free. Once you are logged into your dashboard, click the link to create a new app. Give the app a name and click 'Create App'. 

###### NOTE: Heroku has pretty straight forward instructions on how to proceed. You can just copy and paste the commands it lists if you choose.

Scroll down until you see 'Deploy using Heroku Git'. Make sure you download and the [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) before proceeding. 

From here, make sure you are in your app root and that you have initiated a git repo. Then, you can use the heroku cli to set up heroku as a remote for your repo. `heroku git:remote -a <your_app_name>`. Then make sure you commit all changes. Next, run `git push heroku master`. This tells git to push our current master branch up to Heroku. 

At this point our app should be deployed and running on a Heroku server! The last step is to make sure we run all our migrations. `heroku run python manage.py migrate`. 

You can visit your app by pasting the unique URL Heroku provides into your browser, or by clicking 'Open App' in the upper right corner of you Heroku dashboard.
