### Video Resources (Mike Platoon)
- [Week 7 Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsuO9V9IVgQ&list=PLu0CiQ7bzwEQ8rnjEdmNVERsTqITX7ZY_)

## Topics Covered
- Catch Up Day

## Goals
- Review the new Django concepts from this week
- Catch up on assignments you haven't completed

## Lesson

- We are going to leave today open as a catch up and/or review day for Django concepts. There was a lot of content thrown at you and this is your day to catch your breath. We are available to do impromptu lectures as needed.

- Focus mostly on the [Ticketmaster](https://github.com/novemberplatoon/ticketmaster) or [Meetup](https://github.com/novemberplatoon/django-meetup) challenges for today as they combine nearly all of the concepts we've been learning the last week.

- If you are done, move onto a 'pick-your-own' project: make a website that uses **at least 2** third-party APIs. Need ideas? Check [here](https://rapidapi.com/?utm_campaign=easiest-api-to-learn&utm_medium=link&utm_source=quora), [here](https://apilist.fun/) and [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G3Mu5WBk28_SYQsmOaYWIn6C4Wk21SOSGKrvnJstN1I/edit#gid=0).

- We start React Monday!
