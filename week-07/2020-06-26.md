### Video Resources (Kilo Platoon)
- [Week 7 Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0CiQ7bzwER7wM7xDWo1C3J1juPVT-Si)

We are going to leave today open as a catch up and/or review day for Django concepts. There was a lot of content thrown at you and this is your day to catch your breath. We are available to do impromptu lectures as needed.

Focus mostly on the [Ticketmaster](https://github.com/limaplatoon/ticketmaster) or [Meetup](https://github.com/limaplatoon/django-meetup) challenges for today as they combine nearly all of the concepts we've been learning the last week.

If you are done, move onto a 'pick-your-own' project: make a website that uses **at least 2** third-party APIs. Need ideas? Check [here](https://rapidapi.com/?utm_campaign=easiest-api-to-learn&utm_medium=link&utm_source=quora), [here](https://apilist.fun/) and [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G3Mu5WBk28_SYQsmOaYWIn6C4Wk21SOSGKrvnJstN1I/edit#gid=0).

We start React tomorrow!
