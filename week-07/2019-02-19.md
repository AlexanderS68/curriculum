# CRUD in Django


The majority of code you write professionally for the web will actually share a striking familiarity: it will be focused on performing the same handful of operations on a record in the database. There are a million tiny variations on how this will happen, but at the core, there are only four major operations we'll perform on our data.

In the web world we call this a CRUD app. That is, it has four essential functions:

1. Creating new records
2. Retrieving records
3. Updating existing records
4. Deleting existing records

Twitter is a CRUD app. Instagram is a CRUD app. Salesforce is a CRUD app, and so is Amazon. This pattern is so important, that we're going to spend a big chunk of our week praticing building them. You need to be able to write a simple CRUD interface from memory quickly, so that you can focus on the individual features that differentiate each product.
