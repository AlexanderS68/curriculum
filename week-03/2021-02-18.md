## Topics Covered / Importance
- **Data Structures**
    - Data structures help us to organize data for easy access, addition, and removal and are useful for efficiently storing large datasets.
    - They are also common for interview questions.
- **Python Modules**
    - Python modules help to organize and reuse portions of code; you will certainly need to be able to create and import modules in this course and as a professional developer.

## Goals
**Core**
- Know what a data structure is and understand their purposes
- Learn the different types of data structures and the main operations/methods associated with each
    - Queues and Stacks
    - Binary Search Trees
    - Hash Tables
- Be able to import and use python modules

**Stretch**
- Understand how to construct each type of data structure

## Lesson

**Python Modules**
Using modules in Python allow for you as the author to organize your code and group it together for ease of use. To put it very simply, a module is a file of Python code that you bring into other files. Let's take a look at an example:
```python
# file1.py
def say_hello():
    print('Hey there')


# file2.py
import file1
import file1 as anything
anything.say_hello()
```
We just created two files: `file1.py` and `file2.py`. `file1.py` has a `say_hello` function. `file2.py` has nothing in it, but imports that file in as the name of the file and we can use all the methods in that file. We can also rewrite it as `import file1 as anything` and call `anything.say_hello()`. You can `import` anything into your file by providing the correct relative path to the file. More on that can be found under external resources.
