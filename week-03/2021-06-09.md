## Topics Covered
- **The Call Stack**
- **Recursion**
- **Regular Expressions (Regex)**
  - Regular expressions are a fast and powerful way to interact with strings
- **Destructive vs Non-destructive methods**

## Goals
- Understand the difference between a recursive function and an iterative function
- Implement recursive solutions to challenges
- Explain what the Call Stack is
- Implement Regex methods in Python
- Understand the difference between a destructive method and a non-destructive method

## Lesson
- [The Call Stack](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/123b2TsW6k0OfvBOH4fmVkKUq7xT3WZ1SEWEUBpfnrqc/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Recursion](../page-resources/recursion.pdf)


**The Call Stack**
- A stack is a type of data structure, similar to a Python list. The difference is, a stack follows a Last In First Out (LIFO) model.
  - Think of a deck of playing cards. The first card you're able to pick up is the last card added to the top of the deck.
- The Call Stack is what keeps track of functions that are executing. When a function is invoked, it's added to the top of the stack, and removed once it's resolved.
- If another function is beneath the latest one on the Call Stack, it cannot resolve until the top function has finished resolving
```python
def first():
    second()
    print('first function resolving...')
    return

def second():
    third()
    print('second function resolving...')
    return

def third():
    print('third function resolving...')
    return

first()
```

- The output of this will be
```
'third function resolving...'
'second function resolving...'
'first function resolving...'
```
because the first function can't print until the second function is done, and the second function can't finish until the third function finishes.

**Recursion**

- Recursion is what happens when a function invokes itself. Like an iterative loop, it'll keep invoking itself until a certain condition is met
  - The finishing condition for a recursive solution is called a "base case", a condition where the function no longer returns itself. Without a base case, a recursive function will run until the Call Stack is completely full. In other words, a Stack Overflow.
- Let's consider a simple linear search function. An iterative solution would use a for loop, like this:
```javascript
function linear_search(array, search_item) {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    if (array[i] == search_item) {
      return true
    }
  }
  return false
}
```
- A recursive solution would need one or more base cases. One of them is obvious: we find the item we're looking for.
  - The other one has to be something that one of our recursions will eventually hit. Perhaps this?
```javascript
function linear_search(array, search_item) {
  if (array.length == 0) {
    return false
  }
  let last_item = array.pop()
  if (last_item == search_item) {
    return true
  }
  else {
    return linear_search(array)
  }
}
```
- In this solution, `.pop()` removes the last item from the array and returns it. If the last item is a match for our `search_item`, then we can return true. If not, we invoke the function again with the shortened array. Our second base case comes when we empty the array entirely. If the array is empty, the `search_item` is not present at all, so we return false.
- Any problem that can be solved with a loop can also be solved with recursion (and vice versa):
```javascript
// ------ITERATION
function space_x_countdown(num) {
  for (let i = num; i > 0; i--) {
    console.log(i)
  }
  return console.log("LIFTOFF!")
}

// ---RECURSION
function space_x_countdown(num) {
  // BASE CASE
  if (num == 0) {
    return console.log("LIFTOFF!")
  }
  console.log(num)
  return space_x_countdown(num-1)
}

//------ RECURSION ADD UP TO -----
let addUpTo = (num) => {
    if (num === 1) {
        return 1
    }
    return num + addUpTo(num-1)
}

addUpTo(10)
```

**Regular Expressions (Regex)**
- Regular Expressions, or regex, is the ability to use patterns to match character combinations. While every language has slightly different patterns to match these combinations, they fundamentally work the same
- It basically works like this:
  - A user inputs some text
  - Your compiler, using whatever language you decide, reads that input and pattern-matches it.
  - If it passes, do one thing. If it does not, do something else
- This is useful for something like phone number inputs or social security methods because people are terrible at putting their information into a form
  - For phone numbers, some people use parenthesis, others use periods, others use dashes, and others don't have any delimeters
  - Regex helps with this because they look for consistent patterns. In our case, we just want the numbers associated with a phone number input and to ignore the rest of the characters
- It's recommended for you to use `raw strings` instead of regular Python strings by prepending your string with `r` (e.g., `r("Hello\n\n")`). These raw strings will interpret the escaped characters as literally escaped characters, rather than Python's usual treatment of them as new line characters. **Let's get started on this**:
```python
import re # stands for Regular Expressions and brings in the Python re library into this file
## re.search() will search a string you pass in to see if it matches the regex pattern you have
string = 'June 24'
regex_pattern = r"([a-zA-Z]+) (\d+)" # any combination of letters, capital or not, followed by a space, followed by a digit of any length
print(re.search(regex_pattern, string)) # returns a `match` object with the thing that's matched up. This matches anywhere in the string
print(re.match(regex_pattern, string)) # same as above, but this matches the string starting from the beginning. only returns the first match
print(re.findall(regex_pattern, 'June 24 August 1 December 22')) # this returns a list of all matches
```
- Another example:
```python
import re
regex = r"[a-zA-Z]+ \d+"
matches = re.findall(regex, "June 24, August 9, Dec 12")
for match in matches:
    print(f"Full match: {match}")

## Find and replace
## replaced_string = re.sub(pattern, replacement_pattern, input_str, count, flags=0)
regex = r"([a-zA-Z]+) (\d+)"

print(re.sub(regex, r"\2 of \1", "June 24, August 9, Dec 12")) # 24 of June, 9 of August, 12 of Dec
```

**Destructive vs. Non-destructive Methods**
- In every language, there are destructive and non-destructive methods. Destructive methods are those that change the original data where non-destructive methods are those that do not change the original data. You have to be careful with the methods that you use as there isn't a clear indication in Python or JS as to which are destructive and which aren't. Let's take a look at the example below:
```python
first_name = 'jonathan'
first_name.capitalize() # this is a string method that converts the first character to upper case
first_name # we see that despite running the method above, my original data does not change

last_name = 'young'
last_name.replace('g', '123')
last_name # same case here - this is a non destructive method


staff = ['jon', 'rod', 'ankur', 'chad', 'alicia']
staff.append('tom')
staff # this is a destructive method because it alters the original
## Let's fire tom. He sucks.
staff.pop
staff # my original has been changed yet again!
```
