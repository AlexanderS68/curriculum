# Weekly Topic
- ### Object Orientation Programming (OOP)
- ### Recursion
- ### Regex
- ### Python packages & Javascript libraries

# Why is it important?
- ### OOP is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects
- ### Understanding OOP is important to know how to structure and break down problems & is used a lot in Python
- ### Recursion is important because it often allows a breathtakingly simple algorithmic solution to certain problems that would otherwise be practically unobtainable with an iterative algorithm.
- ### Understanding the basics of regex to help solve technical problems when other approches are more cumbersome
- ### Modules/Packages are essentail to software development since it allows you to perform specific tasks without having to reinvent the wheel or solve a problem from scratch

# What you'll be able to accomplish after this topic
1. ### Create Objects using OOP
2. ### Ability to use Recursions to solve challenges
3. ### Use regex to solve challenges
4. ### Use modules/packages to help you execute your program more effectively
