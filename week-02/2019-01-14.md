## Test-Driven Development
Test-driven development (TDD) is the process of writing tests before you write any code. It's an important part of Agile software development and leads to better software for a number of reasons. The two that are most prominent:
1. As a developer, you are forced to think through what your program is supposed to do before you start writing code. It guarantees that whatever you write does what you want and accounts for edge cases.
2. It ensures that the code that you write integrates well into your overall program so that it doesn't break everything.

Each language has its own testing framework. In Javascript, it's Mocha/Chai, in Ruby it's RSPEC, and in Python, we use [Mamba](https://github.com/nestorsalceda/mamba). In case you haven't realized, there are a lot of snake names with Python.

Today, we're going to take a closer look at the example from the Mamba website. Before we get started, let's install that Python package on our computer by running:

```bash
$ brew install pipenv
$ pipenv install expects
$ pipenv install mamba
```

First, let's write some tests in `tennis_spec.py`:

```python
from mamba import description, context, it
from expects import expect, equal

with description('Tennis') as self:
  with it('starts with 0 - 0 score'):
    player_1 = "Rafa Nadal"
    player_2 = "Roger Federer"
    game = Game(player_1, player_2)

    expect(game.score()).to(equal((0, 0)))
```

Before we run this, let's take a look at each line. Starting with the first line, `from` the `mamba` package, we `import` (or bring in) the subpackages `description, context, and it`. Same thing with the second line. Moving on, `Tennis` is merely a human readable string to show up a bit nicer on the output of your terminal. The `it` block is telling the reader what behavior we want to see and the `expect`...`.to(equal)` is what code we are running / what we expect the result to be. If we run it, we will get a failure.

```bash
$ pipenv run mamba tennis_spec.py
```

Prior to Mamba, you had a bunch of true/false statements without line numbers to tell you what broke and it also didn't tell you what was broken. Now that your tests are failing in Mamba, you know what line is broken, what is broken, and an idea of where to go next. Take a look at the output and how desriptive it is! Line numbers, file names, and a clear indication of what's wrong.

Let's write the code to make this pass:
```python
from mamba import description, context, it
from expects import expect, equal

import tennis

with description('Tennis') as self:
  with it('starts with 0 - 0 score'):
    player_1 = "Rafa Nadal"
    player_2 = "Roger Federer"
    game = tennis.Game(player_1, player_2)

    expect(game.score()).to(equal((0, 0)))



class Game(object):
    def __init__(self, player1, player2):
      pass

    def score(self):
      return (0, 0)
```

Running it again, we'll get passing tests!

### Python Challenges (Make sure to TDD and use Mamba to test!)
* [Armstrong Numbers](https://github.com/golfplatoon/armstrong)
  * Use TDD for this to get yourself started! TDD can take the place of pseudocode.
  * Make sure you use a TDD approach in Mamba to guide your development
