### Lecture Topics
* Regular Expressions / Regex
  * Regular Expressions, or regex, is the ability to use patterns to match character combinations. While every language has slightly different patterns to match these combinations, they fundamentally work the same
  * It basically works like this:
    * A user inputs some text
    * Your compiler, using whatever language you decide, reads that input and pattern-matches it.
    * If it passes, do one thing. If it does not, do something else
  * This is useful for something like phone number inputs or social security methods because people are terrible at putting their information into a form
    * For phone numbers, some people use parenthesis, others use periods, others use dashes, and others don't have any delimeters
    * Regex helps with this because they look for consistent patterns. In our case, we just want the numbers associated with a phone number input and to ignore the rest of the characters
  * [RegexOne](https://regexone.com/references/python) has a good writeup on how this works in Python
* Destructive vs. Non-destructive Methods
  * In every language, there are destructive and non-destructive methods. Destructive methods are those that change the original data where non-destructive methods are those that do not change the original data. You have to be careful with the methods that you use as there isn't a clear indication in Python or JS as to which are destructive and which aren't. Let's take a look at the example below:
```python
first_name = 'jonathan'
first_name.capitalize() # this is a string method that converts the first character to upper case
first_name # we see that despite running the method above, my original data does not change

last_name = 'young'
last_name.replace('g', '123')
last_name # same case here - this is a non destructive method


staff = ['jon', 'rod', 'josh', 'alicia']
staff.append('tom')
staff # this is a destructive method because it alters the original
# Let's fire tom. He sucks.
staff.pop
staff # my original has been changed yet again!
```
