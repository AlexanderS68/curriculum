## Retracking Plan
* If you feel as if you've been struggling so far or still need to pass any of the first 3 assessments, take the next 2 days to go back and/or finish the assessments. If you need help, please don't hesitate to come to your instructors.
* Click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CFR-VHH8Y7RBE1Df3yp2Ce0vewPjexqf4TKthYtFkbs/edit?usp=sharing) and work on the challenges appropriate to the topic you need to review
* If you feel good, feel free to either move ahead in the curriculum to get some familiarity with Django and/or React (you don't need to know one before the other) or create a blog/website for yourself.

# Claim your own website / Create a blog
* Github [Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a service from Github where they host a website associated with your Github username free of charge.
* Claim your Pages account and create your own personal website. 
  * Decide what you want your website to look like - what do you want it to do? 
  * Do you want to have a technical blog? Do you just want to post pictures of your cat? Think about your stack you want for your website.
  * Do you want to use HTML/CSS to write everything? Do you want to use Bootstrap templates to create the overall look?
 * If you are interested in having a technical blog, first create the look of the site. Then look into [Jekyl](https://jekyllrb.com/) to get started - no database required!
 * If you're looking to get a good bootstrap template, I recommend [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/template-categories/all/) and [Bootstrapmade](https://bootstrapmade.com/)

# Please Note
