- [Week 5 Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0CiQ7bzwEQd8JEdJEAcoJzLSwvNO46m)

## Topics Covered
- **HTML**
  - HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages. Everything you see on the internet is a web page of sorts and contains an HTML file.
- **Wireframing**
  - Wireframing is a quick and effective way to identify usability issues early on in your design process.
  - It allows you to determine the architecture of your HTML document
  - It allows you to determine which tags go where in your HTML document
- **Interacting with the DOM**
  - The DOM is everything you see on the screen

## Goals
**Core**
- Understand the basic HTML file architecture
- Learn wireframing techniques to quickly sketch out a design plan
- Learn how to use Javascript to interact with web pages

**Stretch**
- Use built-in methods to interact with the DOM
- Learn to inpsect web pages using Chrome's Developer Tools

## Lesson
**HTML Tag Architecture**

```html
<!-- index.html  -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>Code Platoon!</title>

  <link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet" /> <!-- A link to our style sheet  -->
  <script src="app.js" defer></script> <!-- A link to our javascript file  that will interact with our webpage -->

</head>
<body>
  <h1 id="title" >My Website</h1>
  <p class='sub-title'>Subtitle for my website</p>
  <!-- The rest of your HTML goes here  -->
</body>
</html>

```

**HTML Elements & Tags**

HTML consists of __elements__ which are the building blocks to HTML pages and which are represented by HTML __tags__.
```html
<!-- index.html  -->

<!-- An HTML element is the start of an HTML tag and the end of an HTML tag. -->
<h1>This is a heading tag</h1>

<!-- This is an HTML element with a button tag -->
<button>PRESS HERE</button>
```

**Basic HTML Tags**

![BASIC HTML TAGS](https://github.com/mikeplatoon/curriculum/blob/master/week-05/images/Basic%20HTML%20Tags.png)

[Here is a list of HTML Tags from HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp) and [htmlreference.io](https://htmlreference.io/)


**HTML Attributes (__id__ & __class__)**

When styling webpages with colors, fonts, sizes, and photos you will rarely apply CSS properties directly to the __element__ or __tag__.
```html
<!-- index.html -->
<h1>My Website</h1>
<p>Subtitle for my website</p>
```

You will apply an __id__ or __class__ to select the desired HTML element. The difference between an __id__ and a __class__ is that an __id__ can be used to identify only one element, whereas a __class__ can be used to identify more than one.

```html
<!-- index.html -->
<h1 id="title" >My Website</h1>
<p class='sub-title'>Subtitle for my website</p>
```

```css
/* styles.css */
#title {
  font-size: 34px;
  text-align: center;
  color: #66B6FF
}

.sub-title {
  font-size: 18px;
  text-align: center
}
```

**How do we know what tags to use and where they go? (Wire Framing/Boxing)**

Below is a static webpage that we want to replicate in HTML. Before we just jump right into writing out a HTML file lets develop a visual plan on what tags and elements we need to use.

Using a piece of paper, we draw a box where each incapsulating tag should go for the below static webpage.


![Basic HTML Webpage](https://github.com/mikeplatoon/curriculum/blob/master/week-05/images/html_static_page.png)


__Boxing example:__
Every single box will be a __tag__ within your HTML `<body>` __element__.

![Boxing Examples](https://github.com/mikeplatoon/curriculum/blob/master/week-05/images/boxing.png)

__Boxing to HTML example:__

```html
<!-- index.html  -->
-> HTML Head Tag goes here
<body>
  <nav>
    <p>Company Name</p>
    <div>
      <p>FEATURES</p>
      <p>ENTERPRISE</p>
      <p>SUPPORT</p>
      <button>Login</button>
    </div>
  </nav>

  <!-- ... The rest of your HTML -->

</body>

```

**Using Javascript to interact with your web page (The Document Object Model or DOM)**

Javascript is the programming language of the web. Javascript can update and change both the HTML and CSS of your webpage. __It can also perform calculations, manipulate, and validate data.__

For example: When you enter your name into a form, Javascript will be running code in the background to validate the form.

**__Using Javascript to select HTML tags__**

In the HTML File we want to use a `<script>` element to use our Javascript file within the web page. You can either put your `<script>` within the `<head>` element, where the `<title>` element is also located or at the end of the `<body>` element. Include a `src=` attribute and put it equal to the location of your Javacript file in relation to the `index.html` file.
```html
<!-- index.html  -->
<head>
  <!-- other Tags (title, link, meta, etc)  -->
  <script src="app.js" async defer></script>
</head>
```

The `defer` attribute within the `<script>` element indicates to the browser to execute this script after the DOM 'web page' has been parsed.

__Our `index.html` page__

Create an `index.html` file and copy the below code into your html file.
```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <title></title>
    <meta name="description" content="">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
    <script src="app.js" async defer></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button id='alert-button' >Alert Me!</button>

  </body>
</html>
```

Next, create an `app.js` file and copy the below code into your Javascript file.
```js
// app.js

document.getElementById('alert-button').onclick = () => {
  return alert("Hello Code Platoon!")
}
```

__To access your webpage's `document` in Javascript and gain access to you HTML elements and tags, in your JS file use the `document.` + *someMethod* to perform specific actions on your web page.__

Examples:
* [document.getElementById()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById)
* [document.getElementsByClassName()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementsByClassName)
* [Other Document Object Properties and Methods](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_document.asp)

__To open your HTML file in the browser, in your terminal type the following command:__

`$ open index.html`

**Chrome Dev Tools `cmd + option + j`**

Google Chrome has built in Developer Tools to assist developers to see what's going on in your HTML and Javascript in the webpage.

__Shortcut to Open Chrome's Developer Tools: `cmd + option + j`__
