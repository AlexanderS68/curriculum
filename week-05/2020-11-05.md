## Lesson
**Github Pages**
For your personal site you'll be using Github pages as a host. Find more information on how to do this in external resources. If you're familiary with Ruby you can use Jekyll to help you build your Github personal page via the Jekyll tutorial in external resources, otherwise continue to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Make your website something to be proud of! Does it still look good from a phone? Does it have links to all your front-end projects? Is it user interactive? Maybe you can add animations, or [easter eggs](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/easter_egg.html)
