# Bootstrap
As web sites become more complicated, so does the task of handling styles and layout. Enter CSS frameworks. A CSS framework is just a set a pre-defined styles (and sometimes Javascript functions) that help us keep styles consistent and responsive. Some popular frame-works are Google's [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/), [Foundation](https://foundation.zurb.com/), and the one we'll explore today, Twitter's [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). It's important to note that, though frameworks can seem like magic, they are just using regular CSS and JS under the hood. We can apply these pre-written styles by adding special classes to our HTML elements.

## Installing
You can [install bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/) with npm (we'll do that when we get to react), but for now, we'll use something called a CDN to load Bootstrap into our `index.html` file. This just means that we provide a link to our HTML page so that it can load the Bootstrap library directly from the Twitter Bootstrap servers when it loads.

```HTML
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no">

    <!-- Bootstrap CSS -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-ggOyR0iXCbMQv3Xipma34MD+dH/1fQ784/j6cY/iJTQUOhcWr7x9JvoRxT2MZw1T" crossorigin="anonymous">

    <title>Bootstrap</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>

    <!-- Optional JavaScript -->
    <!-- jQuery first, then Popper.js, then Bootstrap JS -->
    <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/popper.js/1.14.7/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-UO2eT0CpHqdSJQ6hJty5KVphtPhzWj9WO1clHTMGa3JDZwrnQq4sF86dIHNDz0W1" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
    <script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-JjSmVgyd0p3pXB1rRibZUAYoIIy6OrQ6VrjIEaFf/nJGzIxFDsf4x0xIM+B07jRM" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

From here, we'll build out a generic home page to get a sense of how Bootstrap works.

## Navbar

Let's start by using Bootstrap to create a [navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/) for our webpage. Add the following code to `index.html`.

```HTML
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
  <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Navbar</a>
  <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#navbarSupportedContent" aria-controls="navbarSupportedContent" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
    <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
  </button>

  <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarSupportedContent">
    <ul class="navbar-nav mr-auto">
      <li class="nav-item active">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Home <span class="sr-only">(current)</span></a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Link</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item dropdown">
        <a class="nav-link dropdown-toggle" href="#" id="navbarDropdown" role="button" data-toggle="dropdown" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false">
          Dropdown
        </a>
        <div class="dropdown-menu" aria-labelledby="navbarDropdown">
          <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Action</a>
          <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Another action</a>
          <div class="dropdown-divider"></div>
          <a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Something else here</a>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link disabled" href="#">Disabled</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <form class="form-inline my-2 my-lg-0">
      <input class="form-control mr-sm-2" type="search" placeholder="Search" aria-label="Search">
      <button class="btn btn-outline-success my-2 my-sm-0" type="submit">Search</button>
    </form>
  </div>
</nav>
```
There's a lot going on here. Our main parent component, `nav` holds all the HTML that makes up our navigation for the site. The important thing to note here are all the classes being applied to our different elements. Open this file in your browser to see a fully styled and positioned nav bar. We haven't written a single line of CSS yet. Instead, we tap into classes already defined by Bootstrap.

The other great thing about Bootstrap is that it is responsize. Resize your window and you'll see that at a certain point the navbar items will dissapear and you'll have a new button appear in the upper right hand corner. Clicking it will create a drop down menu for all of our nav items.

Let's add a few more Bootstrap elements to our HTML page.

[Jumbotron](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/jumbotron/) elements can be set to a specific size or, in our case, be set to fluid so that they take up the entire window.

```HTML
<div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid">
  <div class="container">
    <h1 class="display-1">Welcome</h1>
      <p class="lead">This is a modified jumbotron that occupies the entire horizontal space of its parent.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```


[Cards]() are nice for things like articles, videos or other contained data. (Though you can use them any way you like!) Let's add three in a row.

```HTML
<div class="card col-sm" style="width: 18rem;">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Card subtitle</h6>
    <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
    <a href="#" class="card-link">Card link</a>
    <a href="#" class="card-link">Another link</a>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card col-sm" style="width: 18rem;">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Card subtitle</h6>
    <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
    <a href="#" class="card-link">Card link</a>
    <a href="#" class="card-link">Another link</a>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="card col-sm" style="width: 18rem;">
  <div class="card-body">
    <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
    <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Card subtitle</h6>
    <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
    <a href="#" class="card-link">Card link</a>
    <a href="#" class="card-link">Another link</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

Each card is styled so that the content is evenly spaced, but they are all stacked one on top of the other. It would be better if we could get them side by side. Luckily, Bootstrap comes with its own way to handle layouts that is very similar to CSS Grid. First, we need to wrap our cards in a container div. Then, we add another `div` with class `row`. (If we wanted coloumns we could add more `div`s with class `col`) This will ensure that all our cards show up side by side.

```HTML
<div class='container'>
  <div class='row'>
  <!-- our card divs go inside  -->
  </div>
</div>
```
Bootstrap can do a lot more than what we've looked at today. Like anything else, it may take a bit of research / practice, but once you get the hang of it, it will make your life a whole lot easier.

## Custom Styles

We can combine our own styles with the ones that Bootstrap gives us. Create a new file `styles.css` in the same directory as `index.html`. Then, import the file in the head. Make sure you import it **after** you import Bootstrap. Then, let's remove `navbar-light bg-light` from our `nav` element. These classes were adding some color to our navbar, but we want to add our own. Next, copy the following code into `styles.css`.

```CSS
.navbar {
  background-color: blue
}
```
As long as we import our own styles **after** Bootstrap's, we can override add or override any of Bootstraps defaults.
Most modern sites use a combination of Bootstrap (or some other framework) and their own styles.


# Javascript
So far we've been using [node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js) to run our javascript code in the terminal. This is a relatively new development for Javascript. Originally, it was created to run exclusively in the browser so that developers could add behavior to web pages. Since then it has become the primary language of the web. This week we'll be spending some time looking at how Javascript runs in the broswer, and how we can use it to make our web pages more dynamic.

## The DOM
Before we can start using Javascript on our front end, we need to understand what the DOM is and how it works. When the browser recieves a webpage (HTML and CSS) it breaks it up into a tree like structure that is called the Document Object Model (DOM).

![The DOM](./images/DOM.png)

Each element in our HTML document is represented as a node in the DOM. We can use Javascript to access these nodes and manipulate them. Let's start with a simple HTML file. Create a file called `index.html` and paste the following code:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>JS and The DOM</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class='container' >
    <h1 id='heading'>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p id='article-1'>An interesting article goes here.</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```
Open this file in Chrome. Then, right click anywhere on the page and select **Inspect** from the menu. This will open the Chrome Dev Tools. If you haven't used the Dev Tools before they can be a little overwhelming. It's important to get used to them, however, as they are an essential tool in a web developer's tool belt.

<img src='./images/inspect.png' width='300px'>
<img src='./images/devtools.png' width='500px' style='padding-bottom:100px'>

We won't go over every single tab in the dev tools today, though eventually you should become familiar with all of them. Today we'll focus on the Elements tab and the Console tab.

The Elements tab will show us the HTML structure of our web page. We can click the grey arrows next to an element to open it up and reveal its child elements. Open the `body` tag and then our container `div`. Hover your mouse over the `h1`. Notice how when we hover over an element it gets highlighted on the page. On the far right you can see the CSS that is being applied to the element. Since we haven't written any of our own styles, you'll see the ones the browser has set by default.

## Interacting with the DOM

Click over to the console tab and let's write some Javascript to interact with our page. We can access the entire DOM object with the variable `document`. Type `document` in your console and hit enter. You should get something that looks like our HTML doc. The browser parses it out for us and makes it easy to navigate, but you should get used to thinking of this like a giant Javascript object. It has attributes we can access and methods we can call on it. Most of the interacting we do with the DOM today will be through this `document` object.

Let's use Javascript to change the color of our `h1`. First, we need to get the `h1` element. Then, we can access the `style` attribute and set the color.

We can access elements by their tag (`'h1'`, `'div'`, etc.), class (`'.my-class-name'`), or id (`'#my-id-name'`).

Enter the following code into the console.

```Javascript
document.querySelector('#heading')
```
`querySelector()` will return the first element it finds. If you want all the elments for a query, say all the `span` tags or everything in a certian class, you can use `querySelectorAll()` which will return a collection.

Once we have the element we are looking for, we can save it to a variable and access the style attribute.
```Javascript
const heading = document.querySelector('#heading')
heading.style.color = 'red'
```

Add this code to the console and press enter. You should see the text in the `h1` change to red.

## Events

The browser is always listening, always keeping track of user behavior. It can tell you when a user has clicked on something, when the mouse enters or leaves an element's bounds, the location of the mouse at any given time, and much more. We can tap into these events and use them to react to user behavior. We do that by calling a function called an [Event Listener](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener).

Let's modify our code so that the color doesn't change until a user clicks on the `h1`. Refresh your browser and add the code below to the console and press enter.

```javascript
const heading = document.querySelector('#heading')

heading.addEventListener('click', function(event){
  this.style.color = 'red'
})
```
We call the `addEventListener()` function on our element and pass it two arguments. The first is the type of event we are listening for. (You can find a full list of events [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventListener)). The second argument is a function that we want to run when the event is triggered. This function will take one arguemnt of its own, an `event` object that holds some information about the event iteself.

Now the color should only change after we click on the `h1`.

## Loading JS in HTML

The broswer console is a great place to test and try things out, but it's not really helpful when we want to write longer scripts. Make a new file `script.js` in the same directory as your `index.html` and copy this code into the file.

We need to let our HTML file know that there is some Javascript that we want to load.

```HTML
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>JS and The DOM</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class='container' >
    <h1 id='heading'>Welcome to My Web Page</h1>
    <p id='article-1'>An interesting article goes here.</p>
  </div>
  <!-- We add any JS files we want to run at the bottom of our HTML file.  -->
  <script src='./script.js'></script>
</body>
</html>
```
```javascript
// script.js
const heading = document.querySelector('#heading')

heading.addEventListener('click', function(event){
  this.style.color = 'red'
})
```

We can load any number of Javascript files at the end of our HTML doc, just before the closing `body` tag. We need to put the tags at the bottom because the browser reads the HTML file top to bottom. If we had the `script` tag in the head our `const heading = document.querySelector('#heading')` line would run before the `h1` was actually created. This would cause an error. Putting our `script` tags at the bottom ensures that all the DOM elements load before our Javascript runs.

Reload the page and click on the `h1`. We should have the same behavior as before.
