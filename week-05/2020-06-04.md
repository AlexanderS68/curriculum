## Github Pages

Make your website something to be proud of! Does it still look good from a phone? Does it have links to all your front-end projects? Is it user interactive? Maybe you can add animations, or [easter eggs](https://www.webopedia.com/TERM/E/easter_egg.html)

If you're familiary with Ruby you can use Jekyll to help you build your Github personal page via this [Jekyll Tutorial](https://garycoffey.github.io/posts/blogs/building-portfolio) otherwise continue to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
