## Challenges
* [HTTP Server One](https://github.com/hotelplatoon/http_server_one)

## Retracking Plan
* If you feel as if you've been struggling so far, take the next 3 days during the HTTP workshop to go back and take time to learn the things you've struggled on. HTTP is a nice-to-have in your arsenal but is certainly not a need-to-know like the other topics thus far. If you need help, please don't hesitate to come to your instructors.
* Click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CFR-VHH8Y7RBE1Df3yp2Ce0vewPjexqf4TKthYtFkbs/edit?usp=sharing) and work on the challenges appropriate to the topic you need to review
