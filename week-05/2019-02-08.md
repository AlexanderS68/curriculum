## Morning: Git Workshop #2
### Afternoon: CSS + Bootstrap
* Bootstrap is an open source CSS + JS framework originally developed by Twitter.
* Bootstrap is a giant blob of code that makes one able to develop "good looking" websites rapidly.

Pros:
* Mobile first. Meaning - if configured properly - your website will look nice on smaller screens.
* Compatible with all major browsers, back to Internet Explorer 9.
* Great documentation. [See here.](https://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/)

Cons:
* Makes the web look very homogeneous. Bootstrap everywhere!
* Sometimes you write almost the equivalent amount of code to override Bootstrap as Bootstrap itself.
* You can't _effectively_ use Bootstrap without a sound understanding of HTML and CSS.
