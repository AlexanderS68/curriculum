- [Week 1 Videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0CiQ7bzwESYJl7C3MPTh64EZP0Od-vW)

## Topics Covered
- Review of the entire week

## Goals
**Core**
- Get comfortable using VSCode and traversing your machine through the command line
- Practice Python and JavaScript fundamentals, including data types, arithmetic/conditional operators, and control flow
- Understand basic Git/Github actions, specifically committing, pushing, and pulling
- Use TDD (test-driven development) to develop better programs and habits as a programmer

## Lesson
**Review day!**

There's no new material today. All of the assignments need to be completed in JS and Python, so focus on the syntactic differences between the two languages.
If you are having trouble with anything, let us know and we'll cover it in depth.
