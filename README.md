## Submitting Work for Review
1. Navigate to your desktop from your terminal(`cd ~/desktop`)
2. Hit the `Fork` icon on the top right to copy the repo to your username instead of `julietplatoon`
3. Clone down the repository to your desktop (`git clone REPO_LINK.git`)
4. Checkout a new branch (`git checkout -b SOLO/PAIR_YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`)
5. Update whatever work you need to
6. Add the changes (`git add CHANGED_FILENAME`)
7. Commit the changes (`git commit -m "SOME MESSAGE HERE"`)
   - Repeat the above three steps until you've completed your work, and it's ready to review
8. Push the changes up to Github (`git push origin NAME_OF_BRANCH`)
9. Open a pull request, comparing your forked `branch` to the original `master` branch

## Daily Check-ins
