# Weekly Topics:
- ### Connecting our Django API to our React frontend
- ### AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification
- ### Individual projects
- ### Assessment #4

# Why is it important?
- ### Separating our frontend and backend allows for elegant code organization and easy scalability, allowing us to work on the frontend or backend without having to modify the other.
- ### Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a leading cloud platform, hosting a large portion of the internet.
- ### The AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner examination will give you official certification if passed, allowing you to understand the AWS cloud more fully and pave the way for additional AWS certifications.

# What you'll be able to accomplish after this topic:
1. ### Access Django backends through React frontends to create a full-fledged web application.
2. ### Study and understand more advanced AWS cloud topics.
3. ### More practice deploying web applications to Heroku.
4. ### Have a better understanding of the inner workings of full web apps and build them more efficiently.

# Individual Project:
### The individual project will be your last assessment of the course, assessment #5. It'll push your creativity and technical skills, preparing you for your group capstone project, and for your professional life outside of the cohort.
### You will be required to write a full-stack web app, including nested CRUD, routing, testing, and at least 2 3rd party APIs. Here are the full requirements: [Personal Projects - Assessment 5 Rubric](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zU9ZkwPn5aWxIuC7NJrxr7fBNvUwjQYFm6hZje-_cZE/edit#gid=917997820)
### For inspiration, take a look at this compiled list of public 3rd party APIs: [Github list of 3rd Party APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
