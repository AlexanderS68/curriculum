=====================
We are going to leave today open as a catch up and/or review day. There was a lot of content thrown at you and this is your day to catch your breath. We are available to do impromptu lectures as needed.

Focus mostly on the [Ticketmaster](https://github.com/indiaplatoon/ticketmaster) challenge for today as it combines nearly all of the concepts we've been learning the last week.
