Object Orientation in Javascript
-----------
We've spent quite a bit of time on Python and all of last week on Django. We're going to shift gears and move towards Javascript. If you recall, we've mentioned that once you learn one language/framework well, it's easy to translate to another class. Let's go over that here with our `Person` class:

```javascript
class Person {
  constructor(name, hometown){
    this.name = name
    this.hometown = hometown
  }

  sayHello(){
    return `${this.name} from ${this.hometown}`
  }
}

const jon = new Person('jon', 'nj');
jon.sayHello(); 
```

Let's break this down a little bit. We've created a `Person` class with a `constructor` function. That `constructor` function operates similarly to Python's `def __init__` where you pass in certain parameters that the class will need to know about itself. In our case, we need two parameters/properties (aka `props` for React apps): `name` and `hometown`. The `this.name = name` basically creates an instance variable, similar to Python's `self.name = name`, meaning that we can use `this.name` everywhere inside that particular instance of the class.

The `sayHello` function basically just returns your name and hometown. With that, let's move onto React.

Create React App
----------------
Just like we have `django admin startapp` to create new Django applications, we have a generator, `create-react-app` from Facebook which configures everything together - take a look through the [documentation](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) when you get a chance.

We've installed Node Package Manager (NPM) when we installed Node on the first day. NPX is an updated version of NPM that comes for free with NPM. Let's install a React app by running:
```sh
$ npx create-react-app my-app
$ cd my-app
$ npm start
```
This generator is very similar to Django in that there's a lot of stuff going on. Let's break each one down:

- The `node_modules` folder holds all of our dependencies locally so we're not relying on the web being up and running. This includes Babel, ESLint, Mocha/Chai, etc.
- The `public` folder has a bunch of public-facing assets like the favicon (top corner of the tab which is your company's logo)
- `src` has the main meat of all of our app, especially `index.js` / `index.html` / `index.css`. These `index.*` files are loaded first and are the entrypoints for our React app. The main entrypoint of our app is under the `src` folder: `index.js` where we import `React` and `ReactDOM`:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import registerServiceWorker from './registerServiceWorker';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
registerServiceWorker();
```

The `import React` statement contains the the core React functionality. This includes the code related to markup like you see further down the file and turning that into UI code. `import ReactDom` takes your code and actually can render that out to the page/DOM/browser. We're also relatively importing `App`, which is the file `App.js` and we're calling it into our code.

Moving onto `App.js`: 

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
        </header>
        <p className="App-intro">
          To get started, edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

You can see we are bringing similar code, including React from the `react` library. The `render` function is an example of JSX, which you can think of as the same thing as Python's Jinja2. Jinja templates are HTML, but with Python inside. Similarly, JSX is HTML, but with Javascript in it. At the beginning of React, JSX files had the `.jsx` extension (you may still see this). They quickly realized that JSX was in every single file pretty much so they made every JS file have the JSX extention and took away the `.jsx` explicitive call and made all JS files end with the `.js` extension.

Finally, we're bringing in the CSS into our file. The `index.css` file is basically the layout CSS, while `App.css` is the css file for `App.js`


Our First React App
-------------------
Let's move towards writing an app that has a button on the page that records how many times we actually hit the button. Starting in `App.js`, let's add a `constructor` function:
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) { // constructor is like def initialize in ruby
    super(props) // super brings in / inherits all the props from parent classes (in our case, it's "Component") into your child component
    this.state = {
      clickCount: 0
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
        </header>
        <p className="App-intro">
          To get started, edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;

```

`state` is essentially a hash held at each Component that contains some data. You initialize state when you initialize a new Component by simply declaring it like we did above:

At this time, we'll create an HTML button element in the JSX. Let's just put in `X` to see something on the screen:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      clickCount: 0
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
        </header>
        <p className="App-intro">
          <button> I have been clicked X times </button>
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;

```

Now, we want to bring in the `state` variable `clickedCount`:

```
<button> I've been clicked {this.state.clickCount} times </button>
```

We use curly braces to interpolate JS into our HTML. Similiarly, we used `{% %}` and `{{ }}` to do it for our Python files. We should now see that we've clicked it 0 times. Next, we want to record all the times that we've actually clicked the button - how do we do this?

First, we need an event handler for the button. When the button has been clicked, the event handler will update the `clickCount`:

```
<button onClick={this._handleButtonClick}> I've been clicked {this.state.clickCount} times</button>
```

Next, we're going to create our custom `handleButtonClick` method for this `onClick` event handler. When you create custom methods for event handlers, you generally have an underscore in front of them

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) { 
    super(props) 
    this.state = {
      clickCount: 0
    }
  }

  _handleButtonClick() {
    alert('hi!') //just get something out
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
        </header>
        <p className="App-intro">
          <button onClick={this._handleButtonClick}> I have been clicked {this.state.clickCount} times </button>
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;

```

Add this new method to your event handler. Note that I'm not invoking the method with a parentheses. If I were to invoke it with a parentheses, it would load once the page starts. I want it invoked only when I click on it.

If you click on the button, you should get the alert popping up on the screen. Nice! Now we want to update the state. `setState` is built-in method that can overwrite the state of your Component:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) { 
    super(props) 
    this.state = {
      clickCount: 0
    }
  }

  _handleButtonClick() {
    this.setState({
      clickCount: this.state.clickCount + 1
    })
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
        </header>
        <p className="App-intro">
          <button onClick={this._handleButtonClick}> I have been clicked {this.state.clickCount} times </button>
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;

```

When you click on the button, you see that it royally blows up: `Cannot read property 'setState' of undefined`. The reason behind this is that when the button is clicked, it doesn't have a concept of an owner - it doesn't know what `this` is. To avoid this, you'll need to `bind` the scope to the function so it knows what `this` is. Just as a heads up, most of the time that you use event handlers, you will use `bind` to let the event handler know its scope.

Since `render` is bound to the `class App` and we're calling a function within a function (`_handleButtonClick` to `render`), `_handleButtonClick` is no longer aware of its scope. We can solve this by changing our button code to the following:

```
<button onClick={_handleButtonClick.bind(this)}> I've been clicked {this.state.clickCount} times</button>
```

**Note:** If you ever get stuck with debugging `state`, consider using `console.log` 
```javascript
_handleButtonClick() {
  console.log(this.state) // this will let you know what the state object looks like when you click it
  this.setState({
    clickCount: this.state.clickCount + 1
  })
}
```

Pause for a second
-----------------
We've done a lot and gone through many concepts. If you are struggling with anything, make sure to go back and review it before we starting mucking around with the concepts below.

If you take a look at the button code, we can start to see that it's probably reusable. With that, I want to move my code into its own Component.

Let's copy all the code from `App.js` and put it in `src/components/ButtonComponent/ButtonComponent.js`:
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class ButtonComponent extends Component {
  constructor(props) { 
    super(props)
    this.state = {
      clickCount: 0
    }
  }

  _handleButtonClick() {
    this.setState({
      clickCount: this.state.clickCount + 1
    })
  }

  render(){
    return (
      <button onClick={this._handleButtonClick.bind(this)}> I have been clicked {this.state.clickCount} times</button>
    )
  }
}

export default ButtonComponent;
```

Import it into your App using `import ButtonComponent from './components/ButtonComponent/ButtonComponent'` and remove all the code you copied over into your ButtonComponent. Your `App.js` should now look like this:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import ButtonComponent from './components/ButtonComponent/ButtonComponent'

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
        </header>
        <p className="App-intro">
          <ButtonComponent />
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

You can reuse the `ButtonComponent` over and over again. Since they are separate/independent components, each one will keep track of its own state. To demonstrate this, we can spam the screen with a lot of `ButtonComponents`:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import ButtonComponent from './components/ButtonComponent/ButtonComponent'

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
        </header>
        <p className="App-intro">
          <ButtonComponent />
          <ButtonComponent />
          <ButtonComponent />
          <ButtonComponent />
          <ButtonComponent />
          <ButtonComponent />
          <ButtonComponent />
          <ButtonComponent />
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

We have a ton of buttons! But that's not very programatic. Let's use JS to iterate over collections of components to put them out on the screen:

```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import ButtonComponent from './components/ButtonComponent/ButtonComponent'

class App extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }

  render() {
    let buttons = []; // pay attention here
    for (var index=0; index < 100; index++) {
      buttons.push(<ButtonComponent />);
    }

    return (
      <div className="App">
        <header className="App-header">
          <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
          <h1 className="App-title">Welcome to React</h1>
        </header>
        <p className="App-intro">
          { buttons }
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```

Nice! 100 buttons that each maintain their own state! If you open the console, you will notice that there's a warning called that each element should have a `key` prop. When you are creating an array of lots of React Components, you'll need a `key` prop to differentiate each individual component. Simply add the key to the ButtonComponent: `buttons.push(<ButtonComponent key={index} />);`

Good luck on today's challenges!
